# lambda-samples

This repo has serverless sample code/templates/scripts that I found useful during my quest of learning how to build serverless applications. 



### NOTE

SERVERLESS is not JUST LAMBDA

Serverless includes all the services in which the end user doesn't have to essentially manage/operate the "servers" on which the application/service runs. For ex: It could be services like AWS Fargate, AWS Kinesis,
AWS Athena, Amazon SNS, Azure Functions etc.
